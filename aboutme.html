          <p>
            Originally from Minneapolis, MN, I developed a passion for
            technology early on, fascinated by the workings of video games and
            computers. At age 12, I moved to the small town of Elbow Lake, MN,
            where I attended high school and took my first HTML class, sparking
            my interest in coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with only one coding class offered, I eventually drifted
            away from it. After graduating high school, I pursued an associate
            degree and began a bachelor's program in Business Management at
            Minnesota State University of Moorhead. During this time, I accepted
            a management position at The Boiler Room in downtown Fargo and
            decided to leave school.
          </p>
          <p>
            After ten years in management, I realized it wasn't my true calling.
            While considering a career change, I seized the opportunity to
            attend Emerging Digital Academy, where I rediscovered my passion for
            coding and found my ideal career path. During my time at the
            academy, I worked on various projects, including PantryPal, my first
            application, which helped me hone my skills in React, SQL, and
            JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, reading, playing tabletop
            and video games, golfing, and, of course, coding. I currently live
            in Fargo with my amazing wife, our two dogs, and our two cats. As I
            continue my journey in the tech industry, I aspire to get certified
            in multiple programming languages and cybersecurity, leveraging my
            skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact.
